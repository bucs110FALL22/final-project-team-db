## Project Description

 The basis of our project was inspired by Mike Tyson's Punch Out. The starting screen opens up and has two buttons that are interactable to bring you to the game screen or a screen showing you how to play. Once you load into the game screen the opponent appears and two hands appear which is your character. To win the game you have to get your opponents health to 0 before your health drops to 0, to do so you while have three functions, one to punch, one to block, and one to get back up if you get knocked down.

## User Interface Design

- **Initial Concept**
  -  (etc/initial_concept_project.png)
  -  This screenshot includes the four image screens. The first screen is where the main game happens and all actions of fighting the opponent occurs, the opponent is standing in the background and the user is in the foreground. The second screen is where the game first loads up and shows you the title and asks you two options if you want to "Play" or open up a different screen to learn "How to play", the third screen is the how to play screen so the user isnt lost and knows which buttons to use to play, the fourth screeen is a customization screen for your personal character to change pants color, skin color, and glove color.

## Program Design

* Non-Standard libraries
      *  - pygame
           url - https://www.pygame.org/docs/
           description - pygame is a module for creating video games, it has computer graphics and sound libraries to be used in python
         
           
* Class Interface Design*******
    * (etc/Class Design.png) 
        * ex. ![class diagram](assets/class_diagram.jpg) 
* Classes
    *  Animations- a class that defines all the frame animations, like the animations of the players hands moving, the opponents actions, and the viewing of the arena
         Button- a class that defines multiple button functions, once the button you click it brings you to the next screen corresponding with the action you chose, for example, choosing your difficulty once you start the game or looking at the how to play guide.
         Controller- a class that defines
         Opponent- a class that defines the opponent. This is used to give the opponent its animations to move on the screen and to set its stats based off of difficulty,gives it the functions to be able to attack the player and to be able to have a chance at getting back up if knocked down, also has a way of becoming 'vulnerable' if his punch gets blocked.
         Player- a class that defines the user/player. sets how long you can block for and how long u have to wait to be able to block again and your chances of punches being blocked, makes it so the player is able to punch the opponent and be blocked by him, has the function to mash the spacebar once knocked down for a chance to get back up, also has the animations to make the players hands move to attack the opponent
    
         Scoreboard - a class that defines the scoreboard. Creates two rectangles for the opponent and players healthbar and each get smaller respectively as health decreases, also once the game is over creates text saying you either won or loss depending on the outcome

## Tasks and Responsibilities 

   *  We split up the roles based off our strengths, so Daniel did the animations as he had prior knowledge. He also did the player class and was the software lead. Benicio did the audio,some of the visuals created like the how to play and the spacebar to mash, and the opponent class. We then worked on all the other classes collectively with front/back end and debugged and helped each other out. 

## Testing

  we tested by writing large portions of code, then running, finding errors, then fixing these errors. methods would have print statements to see when it was called. when a method became bugless, we removed the print statments
